# Frequentist Inference: 

In this case study, we’ll learn more about frequentist inference. There are two parts to the case study: 
   * In part A, you’ll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. 
   * In Part B, you’ll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

We’ll be implementing the following concepts as you work through the case study:

   * The z-statistic
   * The t-statistic
   * The Central Limit Theorem
   * Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
   * Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
   * Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
   * Hypothesis testing
